## A brief history
GitHub's Community & Safety team introduced the kebab menu to accommodate comment moderation (hide, report, block) actions. The pattern was later adopted more generally to support "secondary" actions for issues, comments, files, and other components.

[Kat](https://github.com/katmeister) produced an [audit of ‚Äúshow more‚Äù instances](https://github.com/github/design-systems/issues/379) across GitHub, in which she identified several [progressive disclosure patterns](..). After discussing with the Product Design and Design Systems teams, we agreed that the kebab (named after the Octicon in its [horizontal orientation](https://octicons.github.com/icon/kebab-horizontal/)) was a well-understood visual affordance for ‚Äúmore options.‚Äù

## Should I use the kebab menu?
We have several distinct [progressive disclosure patterns](..). The kebab menu is best suited for surfacing secondary actions.

### Use the kebab menu when...
- Have secondary actions or navigation items in a dropdown menu, that may detract from more frequently used options
- There is limited visual space.
- [Destructive actions](#order-from-least-to-most-destructive) may require some friction.
- You anticipate that more items will be added in the future.

### Don't use the kebab menu...
- If you‚Äôre collapsing or expanding a block of content or a UI component, use the  `chevron` octicon
- If you‚Äôre toggling text inline, use the `ellipsis` octicon

## Implementing the kebab menu
The basic markup for a kebab menu utilizes the [Dropdown component](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/dropdown/).

```html
<details class="details-overlay details-reset position-relative d-inline-block">
  <summary class="btn-link" aria-haspopup="true" aria-label="Show options">
    <%= octicon("kebab-horizontal")
  </summary>

  <div class="dropdown-menu dropdown-menu-sw show-more-popover text-gray-dark anim-scale-in" role="menu">
    <button type="button" class="dropdown-item btn-link">Action 1</button>
    <button type="button" class="dropdown-item btn-link">Action 2</button>
    <button type="button" class="dropdown-item btn-link">Action 3</button>
  </div>
</details>
```

### Group by type
Before adding items into your menu, group them by type of action. This is especially important for longer kebab menus with 5+ items.

If you have 3 or more groups, try using visual indicators to make text scanning easier. For example, here are the groups of actions in the comment kebab menu, separated with dividers:

### Order from least to most destructive
When adding items into your kebab menu, order them from least to most destructive actions. A **destructive** action is one that may have negative repercussions, such as removing or moderating content/behavior.

In the large comment menu, the 3 groups are ordered from least to most destructive, as well as the items within each group:

### Visual indicators
- Use dividers to visually group action types. See the [Group by type](#group-by-type) section.
- If you need to communicate a ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù action (usually one that is irreversible), use the  `menu-item-danger` utility class:
