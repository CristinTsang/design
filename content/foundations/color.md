Color plays a critical role in the understanding of an interface. It helps the user know which actions
they can take, and the hierarchy between elements.

## Color palette
Primer’s color system is composed of 8 different hues with 10 steps going from light to dark shades.
Lighter shades are generally used as backgrounds to highlight or create levels of depth.
Darker shades are commonly used for accent colors, text and icons.

## When to use color

In product UI, use color sparingly and with purpose, such as:
- To signal actions
- To communicate feedback
- To categorize data
- To create boundaries around areas of content

### Interaction

**Actions**
You can use color and shape to bring attention to possible actions within the UI. 
These are mostly buttons and links.

[image example]
Use green as the primary color for the critical action on the screen. 
In some cases, outside of the core GitHub UI, you can use blue as the primary color.

[image example]
Use neutral colors (grayscale) for neutral elements that trigger secondary workflows
and non-destructive actions that can be reversed easily. 
It’s possible that more than one neutral action coexists in one single view.

[image example]
Use red elements like the danger button, red borders and red icons to indicate 
that an action is irreversible and/or destructive.

**Selections**
Interactive components can be selected and have several different states.

[image example - may have to be more than one image to show a good range of examples]
Use color to indicate a change of state in navigation, filtering, pagination, and selectable lists.


### Feedback
There are different types of feedback in github.com, it can:

- Be purely informational or neutral
- Communicate success
- Surface an error
- Provide a warning

| Neutral | Success | Error | Warning |
| ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
| blue    | green   | red   | yellow  |

Feedback colors are commonly used in [forms](https://primer.style/css/components/alerts#colors), [alerts](https://primer.style/css/components/alerts),[toasts](https://primer.style/css/components/toasts#variations), and [list items](https://primer.style/css/components/select-menu#list-items).
